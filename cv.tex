  \item From February 5\textsuperscript{th} to 6\textsuperscript{th} 2015 I head organized a two-day session of the European Youth Parliament (EYP) in Villach, Austria. I managed a team of five organizers, together with whom I raised over 1300\,\EURdig{} in public and private funding, negotiated deals with McDonalds and Subway to supply us with food and beverages for our coffee and lunch breaks -- in exchange for various forms of advertisement -- and raised enough interest to get our session on \link{national television}{https://youtu.be/YuwF6MseivQ?t=3m42s} and into various regional newspapers.
	\item I worked on a four-part freelance tutorial project \emph{Building a Text Editor with
      PyQt} \link{published on Binpress}{https://goo.gl/XLZl4z}, currently with
    almost 70 stars \link{on GitHub}{https://goo.gl/wbRcIY}. It was mentioned in PythonWeekly (issue 155) and PyCoder's Weekly (issues 131 and 132) newsletters.
  \item I'm leading a team to develop \link{an architecture-independent assembly simulator}{https://github.com/TUM-LRR/era-gp-sim} in C++14 and Qt5 for educational and scientific purposes. We are primarily focusing on RISC-V as an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), while keeping all technical doors open to support other architectures such as x86 or ARMv7. Next to development, I am responsible for coordination and management of the team.
  \item \link{Mavrchester}{https://github.com/goldsborough/Mavrchester} is a C library implementing the Manchester Encoding protocol for embedded AVR microcontrollers. Manchester Encoding is a physical-layer communication protocol used for Ethernet and wireless radio frequency transmission. I used this library to build a small wireless weather station on an Atmel microcontroller.
  \item \link{latexpp}{https://github.com/goldsborough/latexpp} is a first-of-its kind C++ library for generating LaTeX equations via C++. It supports conversion of LaTeX equations like \texttt{\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}} to HTML as well as JPG, PNG and SVG images. I made it using Google's V8 JavaScript engine to write JavaScript from C++.
  \item \link{dispy}{https://github.com/goldsborough/dispy} is a tiny Python bytecode disassembler that can take any piece of Python code (function, method, class etc.) and prints out the underlying cPython bytecode instructions and arguments making up each line of code.
